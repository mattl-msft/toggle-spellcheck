“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and
“recipients” may be individuals or organizations.

1. Source Code.
   The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work
   for making modifications.

2. Basic Permissions.
   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
   copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
   conditions are met.

   measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
   11 of the WIPO copyright treaty.

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
   receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
   appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice.

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to

    A contributor grants a patent license to practice the contributor's
    essential patent claims.

    If conditions are imposed that contradict this License, they do not
    excuse you from its terms.

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
